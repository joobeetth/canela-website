            I am 20 year old, BSIT student in Our Lady of Fatima University.
            I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I can't stop learning new
            things; the more, the better.

          <h2 class="over-prop"> Proposal 1:</h2>
            <p>In our increasingly eco-conscious world, there is a growing demand for practical ways to live more sustainably. Our project aims to develop a user-friendly mobile app that empowers users to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. The app will feature three main sections: Home, Transportation, and Lifestyle. Within each section, users can explore various sustainable actions, such as reducing energy consumption, choosing eco-friendly transportation options, and adopting sustainable shopping habits. Users will receive personalized recommendations and track their progress, earning rewards and badges for their sustainable achievements. We envision this app as a one-stop resource for anyone looking to reduce their carbon footprint and make more eco-friendly choices.
          </p>
          <h2 class="over-prop"> Proposal 2:</h2>
          <p>With the rise of remote work and busy schedules, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging. Our project seeks to create a virtual fitness coach app that provides personalized fitness and nutrition guidance. Users will have the option to create their own virtual fitness coach, which they can customize to their liking. The coach will guide users through workouts, suggest meal plans, and track their progress over time. The app will also feature a virtual gym for workouts, a kitchen for meal planning, and a dashboard to visualize their fitness journey. This project aims to make fitness more accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their fitness level or location.</p>
          <h2 class="over-prop"> Proposal 3:</h2>
          <p>Learning a new language can be a rewarding but challenging endeavor, often requiring practice with native speakers. Our project envisions a language learning social platform that combines language lessons with social interaction. Users can create profiles and connect with others who speak the language they're learning. The platform will feature chatrooms for language exchange, where users can engage in real conversations to improve their language skills. Interactive lessons, quizzes, and challenges will be integrated into the platform, making learning fun and engaging. This project aims to create a supportive community of language learners and speakers, fostering cultural exchange and language proficiency.</p>
